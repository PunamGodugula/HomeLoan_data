Description:

For a safe and secure lending experience, it is crucial to analyze past data to predict the likelihood of default for future loans. In this project, the objective is to build a deep learning model that can accurately predict whether an applicant will be able to repay a loan based on historical data. However, this task comes with its own challenges, as the dataset is highly imbalanced and contains numerous features that make the problem more complex.

The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can assess the probability of default for loan applicants using deep learning techniques. This will involve preprocessing the data to handle missing values and transforming the dataset into a suitable format for training the model.

The steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. Load the given dataset provided for analysis.
2. Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately.
3. Calculate the percentage of defaults compared to payers in the target column of the dataset. This will help in understanding the data's class imbalance.
If the dataset is imbalanced, balance it using techniques like oversampling or undersampling. This step is important to ensure the model's performance is not biased towards the majority class.
4. Visualize the balanced or imbalanced dataset to gain insights into its distribution and class proportions. This can help in understanding the nature of the data.
5. Encode the necessary columns in the dataset to convert categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for training the deep learning model.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using sensitivity as a metric. Sensitivity measures the model's ability to correctly identify the positive class (applicants likely to default).
7. Calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) to assess the overall performance of the model. The ROC AUC provides an aggregated measure of the model's discrimination power.

By completing these steps, this project aims to develop a robust deep learning model that can effectively predict the chance of default for future loans. This will enable lenders to make informed decisions and mitigate risks, ultimately ensuring a safe and secure lending experience in the finance domain.
